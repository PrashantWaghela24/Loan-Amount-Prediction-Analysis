# Bank Loan Amount Prediction
This project's objective is to predict a continuous featrure 'Loan Amount' using Multi-linear regression model. It is predicted based on the features such as 
Age, gender, Income, Income Stability, Loan Amount request, number of dependents, and defaults. Unsatisfactory results are obtained using basic multi-linear model hence, the model is optimized using the Decision Tree and Random Forest regression analysis. The best results are obtained after optimizing the model to Random Forest regression.
